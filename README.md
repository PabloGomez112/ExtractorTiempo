# Project Presentation 🚀
Hi! This is a small project I've been working on. It involves extracting time information from source code files. 
The program will search for multiple prefixes within the file and, upon finding them, extract the hours and minutes indicated in the file. 
It's a simple code in C.

## Output of the program 📁
The current version 0.1 of the program creates a .csv file for each prefix. 
For instance, if the program receives something like **Report_Name**, it will append the identified prefix, resulting in something like **Report_Name_Prefix**.
However, it has some issues, such as creating a very unusual format. 
Nevertheless, it works fine for the moment.
